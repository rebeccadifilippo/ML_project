\title{Group 65 Team Charter}

\newpage
\section{Purpose}

Our team's purpose is to create a reasonably accurate model to classify Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs) as hazardous or non-hazardous. Using a Kaggle dataset, the team will train a gradient-boosted tree model to intake asteroid features and use them to classify the NEAs.

\section{Team Member Roles}

The team will rotate to fill several roles throughout the course of the project. The roles are: 

\begin{table}[ht]

\caption{Non-technical Roles and Descriptions}
\label{tab:non-technical-roles}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lX}
\toprule
\textbf{Role} & \textbf{Description} \\
\midrule

Meeting Chair - Jake Read & Prepares meeting agenda or discussion points ahead of time. Facilitates team discussions during the meeting to ensure all required points are addressed. When required, leads delegation of workload.  \\ \\
Team Liaison - Rebecca Di Filippo & Acts as the main point of contact between the team and supervisors and/or stakeholders.  \\ \\
Note Taker - Claire Nielsen & Records meeting minutes. \\ \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

The team will assign workload based on even delegation of work, as well as personal expertise or comfort in specific areas of the project. Each member will fill a technical role of developer. \\

\section{Leadership}

The team will delegate and divide workflow as a collaborative discussion. The Meeting Chair may direct the conversation but all members of the team hold equal decision making power. In the event of an impasse a vote will be held between members; in the event of a stalemate the team will seek advice from peers. \\

\section{Meeting Plan}

The team will meet once a week on Thursdays at 3:30pm. Depending on impending workload or deliverables, the team may choose to meet additional times, subject to members' availability. If any member has a conflict with the usual meeting slot, an alternate time may be chosen

\section{Communication Plan}

The team will communicate primarily using a discord chat. The chat will be used to communicate over text as well as meeting calls. Any correspondence with a TA should be done over Outlook or Teams. \\

All teammates will endeavor to attend every scheduled meeting. Should the team unanimously decide a meeting is not required, it may be canceled ahead of time. If a teammate is not able to attend a scheduled meeting, they must provide the others with notice in advance, as early as possible and up to twenty-four hours in advance barring emergency circumstances. Permissible emergency circumstances include but are not limited to: \\

\begin{itemize}
    \item Medical concern (migraine, illness, etc.)
    \item Family emergency
    \item Unforeseen transit issues \\
\end{itemize}

The same list of circumstances applies should a teammate be responsible for the team missing a deliverable deadline. If a deadline is missed, the team will discuss how to avoid the situation by next scheduled meeting latest. \\
